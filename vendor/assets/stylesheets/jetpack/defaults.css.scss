/*  --------------------------------------------------
  Jetpack Defaults
  ================

  This file can optionally be added after the rest of
  Jetpack is loaded.

  This is one of only two modules in Jetpack that include
  *selectors*, the other module being Resetize.

  So if you don't count the CSS reset (I don't), that
  makes this the only file that will actually affect
  your page when it's included.

  This file has two purposes:

  1. If you like the basic styles I've set up here,
     you can just import this and GO.

  2. If you don't like the basic styles I've set up
     here, don't import this file. Instead you can
     copy/paste it into your project and then change
     as desired, or just ignore it and make use of
     the jetpack mixins without any default styles.

  Have fun, happy coding!
