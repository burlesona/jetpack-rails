Changelog:
0.9.0:
- Redo Tabs
- Redo Pills
- Redo Pagination
- The above components now follow the pattern of the new Tables and Forms modules.

0.8.3:
- Remove select_arrow.gif from select in Resetize.
- Remove extranous comment.

0.8.2:
- Changed class "alert_message" to "alert-message" in flash message helper.
  Trying to me more consistent in using hypenation in HTML/CSS, since that's
  generally more standard than snake case.
- Add horizontal form alignment helpers in forms library
- Change form label so it doesn't have to be .control-label if it is first-child
- Fix gray line above div.submit in form-horizontal-responsive
- Change form style naming pattern to match table naming pattern


0.8.1:
- Completely revised the tables library to be based on stack of mixins
- Changed default $light2 to a ligher color.
- Added $medium-line style.
- Added $dark-line style (it was present but had a typo and was unused in 0.8.0)
- Note on the line styles: these are not heavily used, I'm experimenting with
  the usefulness of them right now. They may be removed before 1.0, but I think
  they're kind of a good idea.

0.8.0:
- Significant overhaul to styles:
  The goal of Jetpack is to be a bootstrap that helps without hurting,
  meaning it never gets in your way with styles you have to override.
  While existing versions have done a pretty good job of this, there are
  still a number of "built-in" styles that get included when you use
  different components. That's not the best. This release removes all
  'default' styles and makes sure everything is a mixin or a reset that you
  include by choice, not by default.
- Refined header styles to make them procedural based on base font size.
- Renamed `mixins` module as `core`, to indicate that it's required
- Removed `font` mixin
- Removed `opacity`, `transition`, and `background-clip` mixins
- Moved `respond-to` mixin to core.
- Added `desktop` option for respond_to
- Refined typographic styles.
- Updated Resetize to use more recent bits from Normalize.css
- Completely redid the Forms module to be all mixins
- Add a fluid grid option to fractionalize
- Convert all typography settings to mixins so you can granularly add/remove just the bits you want
- Changed interface module to all mixins
- Added "Defaults" module for grabbing the old selectors
- Changed div.alert_message to div.message in defaults
- Added $light-line style

0.7.0:
- Added `nav_link_to` helper for creating navigation links.
- Added `viewing?` helper to match for view names.
- Added `$responsive` flag to toggle responsive grid throughout an application.
- Changed Fractionalize to use `respond-to` mixin.
- Adjusted typography settings to make H1s not so crazy.
0.6.4:
- Fixed an accidental regression in 0.6.3.
- Added `respond-to` mixin.
0.6.3:
- Adjusted fractionalize to use 'device' width instead of 'width' in media queries.
0.6.2:
- Adjusted resetize style of disabled elements.
- Added definition of disabled elements to forms stylesheet and matched to link button styles.
0.6.1:
- Added image max-width to grid containers so images will automatically downscale as needed.

0.6.0:
- Tweaked default button style to vertical-align: baseline, and adjusted
  the style of the inline_submit mixin so now submit buttons mixed inline will line up next to regular buttons correctly.
- Removed form_button mixin as it no longer served a purpose (see above).
- Adjusted typography to allow setting "base font" application-wide
- Added title helper method.

0.5.1:
- Updated gemspec and gitignore.

0.5.0:
- Added Flash Message helper to standardize display of flash messages.
- Changed flash message default styles to fit new flash message handler.
- Changed heading mixins to not use line-height for whitespace since that breaks strangely on responsive layout.
- Added `view_name` helper method for semantic CSS namespacing.

0.4.3:
- Changed Heading styles to default to 'inherit' instead of a specific color.
- Tiny adjustment to button styles to make them line up better.
- Added description to gemspec.

0.4.2:
- Typo correction... pushed 0.4.1 too soon!

0.4.1:
- Changed Typography module as follows:
  > Created mixins for headings instead of definitions.
  > For backward compatibility I also updated the default definitions to use the new mixins.
+ Note: This is the direction the library is going to go: Mixins > Definitions. My
  eventual goal is to get most or even all of the defitions extracted to their own seperate
  module so users have the option of only including the mixins they want without any other
  styles getting in the way.

0.4.0:
- Major upgrade to Fractionalize module, with the following results:
  > Standard containers are now 1000px wide instead of 960.
  > The layout now uses media queries to respond to three different dimensions:
    - Desktop (More than 1023px wide)
    - Tablet (From 768 to 1023px wide)
    - Mobile (Less than 768px wide)
    The tablet version is just a slightly compressed layout. The mobile version becomes
    one-column.
  > Margins are now fixed at 20px throughout, instead of variable based on the number of columns.
- Corrected Sass Gem dependency to use any version after 3.1.x.

0.3.2:
- Made input widths more intuitive in stacked forms
- Adjusted style so hint spans in forms do not have to be contained in an input div.

0.3.1:
- Fix for check box and radio button definitions, plus supporting simple_form by default.
- Minor fix on table styles and active button styles.

0.3.0:
- Added Kaminari-style pagination.
- Added simple_form style collection check and radio label styles.

0.2.2:
- I disagree with Twitter Boostrap (the main inspiration for the typography styles). List
	items should definitely not be gray by default. <li>'s will now inherit their color.

0.2.1:
- Another minor tweak to danger button style.

0.2.0:
- Moved to semantic versioning as described at http://semver.org
  ( Version 0.1.4 actually added new features and therefore should have been version 0.2 )
- Tweaked danger button style for greater readability

0.1.4:
- Updated readme.
- Fixed password field definition.
- Added form_button and inline_submit mixins.
- Added box-shadow to form buttons to match anchor buttons.

0.1.3:
- Added `standard_input` mixin for one-off situations.
- Added definition for password inputs.

0.1.2:
- Added small button style.

0.1.1:
- Added Changelog.
- Added default styles for date/time select fields.

0.1.0:
- Initial Commit
